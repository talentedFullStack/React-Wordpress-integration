ðŸ¤— Why WordPress plugin development is fun with WP React Starter
Everyone tells us: WordPress plugins are a mess. Our answer is always: Letâ€™s take this opportunity to make the system that powers every third website on the Internet better.

With WP React Starter we have created a modern WordPress development boilerplate which contains everything you are used to from modern web development projects:

React Frontend for reactive user interfaces (with PHP fallback for server-side rendering) - React is a part of WordPress since the Gutenberg release
TypeScript for typesafe frontend development
PHP in an object-oriented style with namespaces for better backend code
Docker development environment to develop all you plugins without manual setup steps
CI/CD integration for automated code quality checks and release management (publish on wordpress.org or wherever you want)
Does that sound like crappy WordPress plugin development or what you really have been looking for for your plugins for a long time? Let's start today with your first WordPress plugin! Create it within 5 minutes, thanks to our CLI create-wp-react-app
